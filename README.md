# phone.py 

This program uses Twilio's API 6.x to lookup who a phone is registrated
to as well as the carrier it is registrated with.
 
Note: Twilio offers free trials that do not charge. You do not need to enter
a credit card or anything. All the features in this program can be used with
the trial account. When you register Twilio will provide you $15.50 worth of credits.
Each request of my program costs $.03 Cents. This means you can submit 516 requests
before you have to register another account.

Details about the Twilio trial account can be found here:

By prepending cell providers email gateway to cell numbers it is possible to send 
emails that get routed to cell numbers as sms messages. This is free.
